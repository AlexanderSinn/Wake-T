Simulate single LPA stage
=========================

This example shows how to generate a Gaussian electron and simulate its evolution
within a laser-driven plasma stage.

The plasma wakefields are calculated using the ``quasistatic_2d`` model and the
laser driver is evolved using the envelope solver.
